Please make sure you have Tensorflow package installed if not, you can install tensorflow using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

This repository is created for machine learning begginers, each code is fully commented, please read the comments carefully to have a clear idea of how neural network works.

```bash
python XOR_Gate
